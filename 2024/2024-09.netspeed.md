# netspeed

My latest fad: [Install Python with Rye](https://mac.install.guide/python/install-rye)

## Explanation:
- **Server (netspeed_server.py):**
  - The server listens on port 80 (by default) for incoming connections.
  - Each connection from a client is handled in a separate thread.
  - The server prints a message every time a new client connects.
  - The server echoes back any data it receives from the client.

- **Client (netspeed_client.py):**
  - The client takes the server's address (IP or DNS) and an optional port as input parameters.
  - It measures the ping latency by sending a small packet and recording the round-trip time.
  - It measures the upload and download speeds by sending/receiving a series of data packets.
  - After performing the speed tests, the client prints the results, including the timestamp, client and server IP addresses, ping latency, upload speed, and download speed.

## How to run:
1. Start the server: 
   ```
   python netspeed_server.py
   ```
2. Run the client with the server address:
   ```
   python netspeed_client.py <server_address> [<port>]
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   python netspeed_client.py 127.0.0.1
   ```
