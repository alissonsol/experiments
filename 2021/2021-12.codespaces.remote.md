# Codespaces remote development

As per the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview), "A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud". After some [local](./2021-11.codespaces.local.md) adventures, let's go to the cloud...

My setup is:

- Windows 11
- Latest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- The [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension
- Cloned the [Yuruna](https://github.com/alissonsol/yuruna) framework parallel to the experiments folder.

That last one means these commands are executed in sequence from the same folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alissonsol/yuruna.git
git clone https://github.com/alissonsol/experiments.git
```

Check the [requirements](https://github.com/alissonsol/yuruna/blob/main/docs/requirements.md) are installed and up-to-date (mainly [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)). For access to the VM, it is assumed that you create a public/private rsa key pair.

```shell
ssh-keygen
```

Take note of the public file (assumed here to be at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). Check the value of `sshPubFile` in `config/azure/resources.yml`.

You should also check what is available for the target region as per the article [How to Find Azure Linux VM Images for Terraform or Packer Deployments](https://gmusumeci.medium.com/how-to-find-azure-linux-vm-images-for-terraform-or-packer-deployments-24e8e0ac68a) (may need to change the `vm-linux` template accordingly). The "resources" (a Linux VM) will be created based on the configuration files in the folder [2021-12.codespaces.remote](./2021-12.codespaces.remote/).

## Azure

### Quotas

Make sure the active subscription will support the creation of the VM within the [quota limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-supportability/per-vm-quota-requests). That is particularly important for [GPUs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu), which have less availability. See documentation on [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits). A quota increase request is made via an [Azure Support request](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest). Free Trial subscriptions aren't eligible for limit or quota increases.

### Create VM in Azure

Make sure you have [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) and the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed. [Authenticate](https://github.com/alissonsol/yuruna/blob/main/docs/authenticate.md) and then enter the command below from the folder `experiments`.

```shell
../yuruna/automation/yuruna.ps1 resources ./2021/2021-12.codespaces.remote azure -debug_mode $true -verbose_mode $true
```

Next... access and Codespaces connection...
