  <!--
    This offscreen document is used to run Transformers.js for ML inference.
    
    Chrome extension service workers don't have DOM access, which is required
    by ONNX Runtime (used by Transformers.js). This offscreen document provides
    a DOM context where the model can run.
    
    The service worker communicates with this document via chrome.runtime messaging.
